# METEOR - MTS DBN Scoring

Java source code for the scoring phase of the **METEOR** application https://github.com/jorgeserras/MTS_OutlierDetection . It relies on the modeling of Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) for the scoring of portions (transitions) and whole Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) using Likelihood functions. Can model stationary and non-stationary networks.

For additional information and examples on how to use the .jar, please see https://github.com/jorgeserras/MTS_OutlierDetection_R .
